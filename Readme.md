# Where's my Poke?

## Brief Intro
spinoff version of popular Where's Waldo game built with Pokemon Characters 
- One needs to find 3 old generation Pokes - Jigglypuff, Charmander, Ivysaur from the large photograph that contains hundreds of jumbled up pokes.
- All the action happens only after clicking through the play button which changes the DOM- the timer, the current player and shows recurring feedback based on the choices made by the player in action
- Along with each click through the photograph, target box is generated along with the options- if the choice comes out to be correct, DOM changes to notify the same.
- Once all the choices are correct, the timer stops and current player data gets displayed in the leaderboard section along with the other players' logs.
- Reset button resets the DOM to initial state to prepare it for next player's turn.
